        There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.

    <h1>
        Notes and Thoughts
    </h1>
    <p>
        How opinionated do I want to be. The question struck me odd because this is a wireframe framework. So in a way
        <em>very</em> opinionated but biased to dirt simple. But this is an HTML/CSS wireframe, and by it's very design
        I want to show some basic interactions.
    </p>

    <p>
        I want to love ems, I really do, but sometimes I need a 1px line.
        For wireframes, being off by 1px is driving me insane.
    </p>

    <p>
        Some thing always feels wrong about empty tags..
    </p>

    <p>
        UTF-8 automatically turning into emojis is both nice, and weird. I wish this was controllable by CSS. There's
        a weird hack where you append &#xFE0E; directly after.
    </p>
    <p>
        Do you make the most common cast easy, but override all other occurrences?
        Or specify the common case to prevent scoping issues, but reduces the ease?
        "Every case is different", so what's the criteria by which you resolve this?
    </p>

    <p>
        Every time I don't transition:all, I end up regretting it.
    </p>

    <p>
        Where the hell are all the cool attr() stuff?
    </p>

    <p>
        Why in the hell can't you style non-inline SVGs with CSS?!
